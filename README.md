# KMITL OSRS Website

KMITL Online Space Reservation System, website part.

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm i` in the project folder to install required dependencies.
2. Run `node server.js` to start the Web server.

## Contributing

* Always run `gulp` to compile Sass and JS files.

## Project Structure

_coming soon_

## Tips

* If changes don't show up, check if you have already run `gulp` (for front-end) and `node` (for back-end).
* Use `nodemon` instead of `node` to automatically restart the server when the _server code_ changes.
